# Getting Started

Let's create a new Nitro app in few steps.

## Play Online

## Starter Template

::callout
#summary
Make sure you have installed the recommended setup:
#content
* **Node.js**<sup>*</sup> (latest LTS version) ðŸ‘‰ [[Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)]
* **Visual Studio Code**  [[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)]
* [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) for using pnpm and yarn. ðŸ‘‰ Run `corepack enable`
::

Create a new project using starter template:

::code-group

```bash [npx]
npx giget@latest nitro nitro-app
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm dlx giget@latest nitro nitro-app
```

```bash [bun]
bunx giget@latest nitro nitro-app
```

::

```sh
cd nitro-app
```

Install the dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn install
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install
```

```bash [bun]
bun install
```

::


Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

ðŸª„ Your API is ready at `http://localhost:3000/`

::alert
Check `.nitro/dev/index.mjs` if want to know what is happening
::

Build your production-ready server:

```bash
npm run build
````

Output is in the `.output` directory and ready to be deployed on almost any provider with no dependencies.

You can try it locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```


## Nightly Release Channel

Nitro offers a nightly release channel that automatically releases for every commit to `main` branch.

You can opt-in to the nightly release channel by updating your `package.json`:

::code-group
```diff [Nitro]
{
  "devDependencies": {
--    "nitropack": "^2.0.0"
++    "nitropack": "npm:nitropack-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```
```diff [Nuxt]
{
  "devDependencies": {
--    "nuxt": "^3.0.0"
++    "nuxt": "npm:nuxt3@latest"
  }
}
```
::

::alert
If you are using Nuxt, [use the Nuxt nightly channel](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/nightly-release-channel#opting-in) as it already includes `nitropack-nightly`.
::

Remove the lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `bun.lockb`) and reinstall the dependencies.
