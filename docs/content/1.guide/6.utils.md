# Utils

Nitro helps you to stay organized allowing you to take advantage of the [`auto-imports`](auto-imports.md) feature.

Every export in the `utils` directory and its subdirectories will become available globally in your application.

## Example

Create a `utils/sum.ts` file where a function `useSum` is exported:

```ts [utils/sum.ts]
export function useSum(a: number, b: number) { return a + b }
```

Use it in your `routes/index.ts` file without importing it:

```ts [routes/index.ts]
export default defineEventHandler(() => {
  const sum = useSum(1, 2) // auto-imported
  return { sum }
})
```
