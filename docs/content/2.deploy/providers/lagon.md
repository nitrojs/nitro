# Lagon

Deploy Nitro apps to Lagon.

> Lagon is an open source platform that allows you to run TypeScript and JavaScript close to your users.

ðŸš§ This is an early access and in progress preset. Please followup via [unjs/nitro#966](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/issues/966)

**Preset:** `lagon` ([switch to this preset](/deploy/#changing-the-deployment-preset))

Nitro supports deploying on [Lagon](https://lagon.app/) with minimal configuration - see [documentation](https://docs.lagon.app/).

## Set up application

1. Build your Nitro app with `NITRO_PRESET=lagon`

1. Install [Lagon CLI](https://docs.lagon.app/cli) and login using `npx @lagon/cli login`.

1. Deploy with `lagon deploy .output/server/index.mjs -p .output/public`. Lagon will ask if you want to link to an existing function or create a new one.

You should be good to go!
