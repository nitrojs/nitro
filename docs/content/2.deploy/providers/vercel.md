## Deploy using Git

1. Push your code to your git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel.
3. Vercel will detect that you are using Nitro and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.
4. Your application is deployed!

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#preview), and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly “main”) will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#production).

Learn more about Vercel’s [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## Vercel Edge Functions

**Preset:** `vercel-edge` ([switch to this preset](/deploy/#changing-the-deployment-preset))

It is possible to deploy your nitro applications directly on [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions).

> Vercel Edge Functions allow you to deliver content to your site's visitors with speed and personalization.
> They are deployed globally by default on Vercel's Edge Network and enable you to move server-side logic to the Edge, close to your visitor's origin.
> Edge Functions use the Vercel Edge Runtime, which is built on the same high-performance V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that is used by the Chrome browser.
> By taking advantage of this small runtime, Edge Functions can have faster cold boots and higher scalability than Serverless Functions.
> Edge Functions run after the cache, and can both cache and return responses. [Read More](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions)

In order to enable this target, please set `NITRO_PRESET` environment variable to `vercel-edge`.

## Custom Build Output Configuration

You can provide additional [build output configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) using `vercel.config` key inside `nitro.config`. It will be merged with built-in auto generated config.
