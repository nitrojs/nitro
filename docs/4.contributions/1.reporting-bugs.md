# Reporting bugs

There might have been a bug during your use of Nitro.

Though we're trying to resolve all the bugs we met, new bugs may emerge with the time lapsed. In this situation, your bug report is the key to helping us find it and fix it in time, even if you can't fix the underlying code of Nitro directly.

Here are some key steps for you to report the bug to us.

## Ensure it's a bug

Sometimes, the thing you want to get help may not be a bug but a feature or other things. Considering the type before you start to report.

## Search the previous issues and discussions

Searching the previous issues and discussions, check if there has an issue or discussion that reported a bug like yours and add a comment to it. This is much better than creating a new but duplicate issue or discussion.

## Create a minimal reproduction

It's very important for you to create a minimal reproduction with our starter template.

Sometimes the bug may not occurred by Nitro but other things (e.g. the JavaScript library you use). A minimal production can not only help you ensure where the bug comes from, but also help us locate the bug and find a solution.

Please use one of the templates below to create a minimal reproduction:

## For Nuxt-related bugs report

If the bug report is related to Nuxt framework, please report it to Nuxt instead of here.
