# Getting Started

> Create web servers with all necessary features and deploy them wherever you prefer.

## Intro

Nitro is an open source framework to build web servers using [unjs/h3](https://h3.unjs.io) and lots of built-in features.
Nitro automatically makes your code compatible with any [deployment](/deploy) provider and runtime!

> [!NOTE]
> Nitro can be used standalone or as the server engine of full-stack frameworks such as [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com).


## Quick start

> [!TIP]
> Instead of setting up a local development environment, you can use the [online playground](https://stackblitz.com/github/unjs/nitro/tree/main/examples/hello-world).

::note
Make sure you have installed the recommended setup:

- Latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), or [Bun](https://bun.sh/).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
::

Create a new project using starter template:

:pm-x{command="giget@latest nitro nitro-app --install"}


```sh
cd nitro-app
```

Start the development server:

:pm-run{script="dev"}

Nitro is ready at `http://localhost:3000/`!

::tip
Check `.nitro/dev/index.mjs` if want to know what is happening
::

Build your production-ready server:

:pm-run{script="build"}

Output is in the `.output` directory and ready to be deployed on almost any provider with no dependencies.

You can try it locally with:

:pm-run{script="preview"}
