# Getting Started

## Quick Start

### Online playground

The easiest way to get started with Nitro is to use the [online playground](https://stackblitz.com/github/unjs/nitro/tree/main/examples/hello-world).

### Starter Template


Make sure you have installed the recommended setup:

- Latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), or [Bun](https://bun.sh/).
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Create a new project using starter template:

:pm-x{command="giget@latest nitro nitro-app --install"}


```sh
cd nitro-app
```

Start the development server:

:pm-run{script="dev"}

Nitro is ready at `http://localhost:3000/`!

::tip
Check `.nitro/dev/index.mjs` if want to know what is happening
::

Build your production-ready server:

:pm-run{script="build"}

Output is in the `.output` directory and ready to be deployed on almost any provider with no dependencies.

You can try it locally with:

:pm-run{script="preview"}

::read-more
You can find more examples in the Nitro repository: [unjs/nitro/examples](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/tree/main/examples)
::

### Files

The starter template some important files to get you started.

##### `package.json`

The `package.json` file contains all the dependencies and scripts for your project.

##### `nitro.config.ts`

The `nitro.config.ts` file contains the configuration for Nitro.

##### `tsconfig.json`

The `tsconfig.json` file contains the TypeScript configuration for your project. It extends an automatically generated `./.nitro/types/tsconfig.json` file that contains the configuration for Nitro.

You can use `npm run prepare` to generate some Nitro files in `.nitro` directory.

::warn
Do not change this file directly, use `typescript` key in `nitro.config.ts` instead.
::

`routes/**/*.{ts,js}`

The `routes` directory contains your application handlers. You can create subdirectories inside `routes` to create nested handlers. The file name is the route path.

## Nightly Release Channel

Nitro offers a nightly release channel that automatically releases for every commit to `main` branch.

You can opt-in to the nightly release channel by updating your `package.json`:

::code-group
```diff [Nitro]
{
  "devDependencies": {
--    "nitropack": "^2.0.0"
++    "nitropack": "npm:nitropack-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```
```diff [Nuxt]
{
  "devDependencies": {
--    "nuxt": "^3.0.0"
++    "nuxt": "npm:nuxt3@latest"
  }
}
```
::

::alert
If you are using Nuxt, [use the Nuxt nightly channel](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/nightly-release-channel#opting-in) as it already includes `nitropack-nightly`.
::

Remove the lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `bun.lockb`) and reinstall the dependencies.
