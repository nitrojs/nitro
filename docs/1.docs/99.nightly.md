# Nightly Channel

> Nitro has a nightly release channel that automatically releases for every commit to `main` branch to try latest changes.

You can opt-in to the nightly release channel by updating your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "nitro": "npm:nitro-nightly@latest"
  }
}
```

Remove the lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock`, or `bun.lockb`) and reinstall the dependencies.
