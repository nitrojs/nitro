## New local project

The fastest way to create a Nitro application is using the `create-nitro-app` package:

:pm-x{command="create-nitro-app"}

Follow the instructions from the CLI and you will be ready to start your development server.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure to have installed the latest LTS version of either [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), or [Deno](https://deno.com/).

## Add to a Vite project

To add Nitro to an existing Vite project, follow these instructions:

::steps{level="3"}

### Install `nitro` package

:pm-install{name="nitro"}

### Add Nitro plugin

```js [vite.config.mjs] {2,6}
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { nitro } from "nitro/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    nitro()
  ],
});
```

That's it, you can now add server and API routes to your Vite project!
