## Deploy using Git

1. Push your code to your git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel.
3. Vercel will detect that you are using Nitro and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.
4. Your application is deployed!

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#preview), and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly “main”) will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#production).
