## Set Up your flightcontrol account

On a high level, the steps you will need to follow to deploy a project for the first time are:

1. Create an account at [Flightcontrol](https://app.flightcontrol.dev/signup?ref=nitro)
2. Create an account at [AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) (if you don't already have one)
3. Link your AWS account to the Flightcontrol
4. Authorize the Flightcontrol GitHub App to access your chosen repositories, public or private.
5. Create a Flightcontrol project with configuration via the Dashboard or with configuration via `flightcontrol.json`.

### Create a project with configuration via the dashboard

1. Create a Flightcontrol project from the Dashboard. Select a repository for the source.
2. Select the `GUI` config type.
3. Select the Nuxt preset. This preset will also work for any Nitro-based applications.
4. Select your preferred AWS server size.
5. Submit the new project form.

### Create a project with configuration via `flightcontrol.json`

1. Create a Flightcontrol project from your dashboard. Select a repository for the source.
2. Select the `flightcontrol.json` config type.
3. Add a new file at the root of your repository called `flightcontrol.json`. Here is an example configuration that creates an AWS fargate service for your app:

  ```json [flightcontrol.json]
  {
    "$schema": "https://app.flightcontrol.dev/schema.json",
    "environments": [
      {
        "id": "production",
        "name": "Production",
        "region": "us-west-2",
        "source": {
          "branch": "main"
        },
        "services": [
          {
            "id": "nitro",
            "buildType": "nixpacks",
            "name": "My Nitro site",
            "type": "fargate",
            "domain": "www.yourdomain.com",
            "outputDirectory": ".output",
            "startCommand": "node .output/server/index.mjs",
            "cpu": 0.25,
            "memory": 0.5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

4. Submit the new project form.
