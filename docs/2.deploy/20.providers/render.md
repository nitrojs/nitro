## Set up application

1. [Create a new Web Service](https://dashboard.render.com/select-repo?type=web) and select the repository that contains your code.
2. Ensure the 'Node' environment is selected.
3. Update the start command to `node .output/server/index.mjs`
4. Click 'Advanced' and add an environment variable with `NITRO_PRESET` set to `render_com`. You may also need to add a `NODE_VERSION` environment variable set to `18` for the build to succeed ([docs](https://render.com/docs/node-version)).
5. Click 'Create Web Service'.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

1. Create a file called `render.yaml` with following content at the root of your repository.

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: <PROJECTNAME>
    env: node
    branch: main
    startCommand: node .output/server/index.mjs
    buildCommand: npx nypm install && npm run build
    envVars:
    - key: NITRO_PRESET
      value: render_com
