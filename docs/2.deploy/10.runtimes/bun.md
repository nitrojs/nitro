# Bun

> Run Nitro apps with Bun runtime.

**Preset:** `bun`

Nitro output is compatible with Bun runtime. While using default [Node.js](/deploy/runtimes/node) you can also run the output in bun, using `bun` preset has advantage of better optimizations.

After building with bun preset using `bun` as preset, you can run server in production using:

```bash
bun run ./.output/server/index.mjs
```
